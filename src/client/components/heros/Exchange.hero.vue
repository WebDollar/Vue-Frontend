			<p>GYMbase.io was the first exchange that saw the potential of our project and listed WebDollar without even being asked for it.</p> 
			<p>WebDollar started trading for its first time on GYMbase.io on February 8th of 2019, just a few days after hybrid (POW + POS) mining was implemented.</p>
			<p>Because our community was eager for an exchange, GYMbase.io soon became overwhelmed by the impressive numbers of WebDollar's trades and volume.</p>

			<p>P2pb2b.io proved to be the perfect big step for WebDollar after hybrid (POW + POS) mining implementation. A top 20 by volume on cmc.io, p2pb2b.io is the fastest growing cryptocurrency exchange in the world.</p>
            <p>WebDollar was listed and traded for the first time on the 20th of March 2019. Only a few days after the listing, our Telegram reached over 10k community members while our Twitter jumped over the 5k followers mark.</p>
			<p>A trading market volume of almost half a billion US dollars made p2pb2b extremely appealing to WebDollar miners, enthusiasts, early adopters, and new owners, for in only a few days after the listing, more than 70 million WEBD was transferred towards the exchange.</p> 
            <p>Pairings are also a true traderâ€™s delight since WEBD is traded on p2pb2b against Ethereum, Bitcoin, and USD.</p>
